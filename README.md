# DeviceWISE Angular API Service

Angular services for communicating with deviceWISE.

# Installation

```cli
npm install devicewise-angular --save
```

Import the devicewise angular module in your `app.module.ts`:

```ts
...
import { DevicewiseAngularModule } from 'devicewise-angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...
    DevicewiseAngularModule.forRoot()
```

Then, import and inject the devicewise angular service into a component:

```ts
...
import { DevicewiseAuthService, DevicewiseApiService } from 'devicewise-angular';
import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  ...
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(
    private dwAuthentication: DevicewiseAuthService,
    private dwApi: DevicewiseApiService
  ) {}
 
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.dwAuthentication.easyLogin('http://localhost:8080', 'admin', 'admin').pipe(
      switchMap((e) => this.dwApi.deviceList())
    ).subscribe((e) => console.log(e));
  }
  ...
```
The `easyLogin` method will automatically save the sessionId from the login request as a cookie. If a cookie already exists it will be checked for validity before emitting sucessful login.

# MultiSubscribe
Using HTTP fetch is a much more efficient way to communicate with devicewise. Consider using the multisubscribe store service to subscribe to a variable rather than poll a variable on an interval.


```ts
...
import { DevicewiseAuthService } from 'devicewise-angular';

@Component({
  ...
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(
    private dwAuthentication: DevicewiseAuthService,
    private dwMultiSubscribeService: DevicewiseMultisubscribeStoreService
  ) { }

  variables: DwVariable[] = [{ device: 'System Monitor', variable: 'CPU.CPU Usage', type: DwType.UINT1, count: 1, length: -1 }];

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.dwAuthentication.easyLogin('http://localhost:8080', 'admin', 'admin').pipe(
      switchMap((e) => this.dwMultiSubscribeService.addRequestVariables(this.variables))
    ).subscribe((e) => console.log('value changed:', e));
  }
  ...
```

Make sure you unsubscribe from the multisubscribe store obervable!

It's also common to save the observable.
```ts
this.multisub$ = this.dwMultiSubscribeService.subscriptionAsObservable();
```
To get a specific variable out of the observable create a pipe containing filter.
```ts
this.multisub$.pipe(
  filter((e) => e.device.name == 'System Monitor' && e.variable.name = 'CPU.CPU Usage')
).subscribe((e) => console.log(e))
```
Another possibility. Create an async pipe in your html template
```html
<div *ngIf="multisub$ | async as variable">
  <p>Value: {{variable.data[0]}}</p>
</div>
```

This multisubscribe store makes it easy to add, remove, and edit variables from a single stream from devicewise.

# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.

Run these steps to enable CORS on deviceWISE.

* Navigate to your deviceWISE install directory
* Open the file "deviceWISE\Runtime\dwcore\dwcore.properties"
* Add the line "#http.allow_origin=http://localhost:4200" anywhere in the file (where http://localhost:4200 is the origin to allow access)
* Save the file
* Restart deviceWISE

# Polyfills
At the bottom of `polyfills.ts` under `APPLICATION IMPORTS` add the following and run the command in the comment.
```ts
/**
 * Fetch Readablestream Polyfills
 * https://github.com/jonnyreeves/fetch-readablestream
 * Run `npm install --save web-streams-polyfill text-encoding babel-polyfill abortcontroller-polyfill`.
 * This is used for subscriptions in IE11.
 */
import 'web-streams-polyfill';
import 'text-encoding';
import 'babel-polyfill';
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill';
```
# What to do now?

* Run `ng test devicewise-angular` to run the tests devicewise angular.
* Have a look at and play around with the `app` to get to know the devicewise service with `ng serve --open`
* Set up other users in deviceWISE (default credentials are admin/admin)

# Running the Demo

Clone the repository.

```cli
git clone https://github.com/telit/devicewise-angular.git
```

Navigate to the folder.

```cli
cd devicewise-angular
```

Install packages.

```cli
npm i
```

Run Demo.

```cli
ng serve --open
```

# FAQ
